# Balanced Team Generator

        Welcome to the Balanced Team Generator app! This simple application is designed for creating balanced sports teams, initially tailored for volleyball but adaptable to other sports as well. You can manually enter player data with the format "PlayerName: Rating" (where the rating is a number from 1 to 5 with 0.5 differences), or import data from a Google Spreadsheet in CSV format ("PlayerName, Rating").
